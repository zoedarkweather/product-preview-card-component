## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned that you can use display flex to vertically align button text.


### Continued development

Keep learning and practicing everything.

### Useful resources

- [Stackoverflow - vertically align button text](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5184856/html-vertical-align-the-text-inside-input-type-button) - The top answer on this one was to make the button display inline flex. I used that idea but made it flex instead.
