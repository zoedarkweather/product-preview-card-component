## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned that you can use display flex to vertically align button text.

9/28 updates:
- Made some changes to the spacing and vertically centered the component on the page to better match design.
- Changed the strikethrough on the price from css to html so it can be correctly read by screenreaders. 
- Changed the button icon to a background image to improve accessibility of the button.
- Added the hover/focus state to the button which I'd forgotten to do
- Edited the product image alt tag to be more descriptive.
- Made the attribution section match the color-scheme, making sure it had a WCAG-passing contrast ratio.
- Tested the page with NVDA and used the Accessibility Inspector in FireFox Dev Tools to check for issues.

### Continued development

Keep learning and practicing everything.

### Useful resources

- [Stackoverflow - vertically align button text](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5184856/html-vertical-align-the-text-inside-input-type-button) - The top answer on this one was to make the button display inline flex. I used that idea but made it flex instead.
